## REQUIRES SUPERWOW AND UNITXP

### Test build -- Based on using UnitXP new AOE function, see opened issue below:
https://github.com/allfoxwy/UnitXP_SP3/issues/8

## Mageplates v1
- Adds Arcane Explosion icon to enemy nameplates that are within distance of arcane explosion around you

### Known issues
- There is a range issue whenever mobs are not perfectly vertically distanced from you (i.e X = 2.6, Y = 9.7). AOE distances are not straight forward and this is a limitation of UNITXP more than myself. Will provide updates as these new functions are updated.
